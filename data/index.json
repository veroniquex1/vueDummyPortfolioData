    "about": [
        "Veronique Nappie, an aspiring full stack web developer. I would consider myself introverted but highly ambitious. I am not likely to wait for an opportunity to come to me but rather create one and not give up until I achieve what I set out to. I matriculated in 2015 from Sans Souci Girls’ High School. Directly after high school I spent a year tutoring high school students. After tutoring, I started my first job in sales, selling insurance for Vodacom. After giving sales a try I transitioned into a customer service from at Amazon. While at Amazon I spent most of my time in the technical support department. It was around this time I also decided to start my post high school education. I registered for a BSc in Physics and Math at Unisa. During my studies I discovered coding when I registered for a module in C++. I’ve always been drawn to solving problems and finding coding has allowed me to do this while being able to create new things too."
